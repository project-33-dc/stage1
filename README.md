it begins here.

this moment you are experiencing is one that is unique to you, but common to others that have come before you. this is a seminal moment in your life, and the timelines of those that you have engaged with previously, and will engage with in the future. This is a progression of your ascension to apotheosis. 

with the weight of the ages, comes a grave responsibility to those in the ascendency. hippocrates once stipulated this as "First do no harm." the world at large is clearly a construct with the ills of said ages still lingering despite our relatively rapid progressions according to various dimensional metrics. the opportunity that then presents itself is such: accept the Gravity of your own capacities and allow the weight of the world to come to u. bind itself with u. and in turn expand, with your newly amalgamated mass and energy, towards a more benevolently entangled, collectively defined future.
